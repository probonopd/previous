WARNING: Do not start NeXTstep 1.0a and earlier with Ethernet
         enabled, unless you configured it using the following
         procedure. There is a bug causing file system corruption
         on 1.x and 0.x hangs in the boot process. The bugs are
         possibly in NeXTstep itself.


Howto: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.8 and 0.9:
   FIXME: No procedure yet.



Howto: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2:

1. On first boot you might be dropped to the single user
   mode console. Just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open "/etc/resolv.conf" and add "nameserver 10.0.2.3".
   If this file does not exist, you have to first create it. 
   Be sure you create a plain text file. If you use Edit.app
   you can do this by selecting Format > Text > Make ASCII.
   You can save the file from the save dialog by typing 
   "/etc/resolv.conf" to the name field.

3. Open NetManager.app (you find it in NextAdmin directory),
   select "Local..." and configure with these values:
   a  Set "Network type" to "Non-NetInfo Network"
   b  For "NIS Domain Name" (2.x) or "Yellow Pages Domain Name"
      (0.x, 1.x) select "None"
   c  Choose a hostname (select whatever you want)
   d  Set "Address" to "10.0.2.15"
   e  Set "Router" to "10.0.2.2"
   f  Set "Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
   g  Set "Netmask" to "255.255.255.0"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.



Howto: Setup networking on NeXTstep 3.0 and later:

1. Use Simple Network Starter (you find it in the NextAdmin directory) 
   and set up some values:
   a  Check "Provide the services specified below."
   b  Choose a hostname (whatever you want).
   c  Set IP address to "10.0.2.15".
   d  Go to "Network Options..." and set 
      Router to "10.0.2.2"
      Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
      Netmask to "255.255.255.0" and
      NIS Domain Name to "None".
   e  Hit configure. You will be prompted to connect the Ethernet
      cable.
   f  If not already done, connect emulated Ethernet now using
      Previous' GUI and hit OK.

2. Using root access rights open and edit these files:
   a  /etc/hostconfig and replace "-ROUTER-" with "10.0.2.2".
   b  /etc/resolv.conf and add "nameserver 10.0.2.3".
      If this file does not exist, you have to first create it. 
      Be sure you create a plain text file. If you use Edit.app
      you can do this by selecting Format > Text > Make ASCII.

   Howto: Open the above files using root privileges (NeXTstep 3.3):
   a  Open the /etc directory with this command in Terminal:
      "open /etc"
   b  Select the file/application to open and from Workspace select 
      Services > Open Sesame > Open As Root.
   c  For making a new resolv.conf open Edit.app the same way (b) 
      and in the save dialog type as name "/etc/resolv.conf"

3. Reboot.
