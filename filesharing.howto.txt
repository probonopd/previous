NOTE: This procedure has been tested using NeXTstep 1.0a and 3.3
      as client and Mac OS X v10.9 as server.

      For this procedure to work networking must be setup first
      (see networking.howto.txt for details).
      To edit files inside /etc you need super user privileges.

      X.X.X.X = Your host system's IP-Address (e.g. 192.168.0.1)
      serverhostname = Your host system's hostname
      clienthostname = Your NeXTstep hostname (see networking.howto)


Howto: Setup NFS file sharing under Mac OS X:

1. Create the folder you want to share and change permissions using
   this command from the command line:
   chmod 777 /Path/To/Shared/Folder

2. Add the folder you want to share to /etc/exports by adding this
   line to the end of the file:
   /Path/To/Shared/Folder -maproot=nobody

3. Load the edited file using these commands from the command line:
   sudo nfsd checkexports
   sudo nfsd enable
   sudo nfsd stop
   sudo nfsd -N

4. You can confirm that the operation was successful using this 
   command:
   showmount -e

NOTE: Step 3 needs to be repeated after every reboot of the host
      system because nfsd -N is not permanent.


Howto: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 3.3:

1. Edit the file "/etc/hosts" by adding your host system to 
   the last line of the file (host system IP-Address followed 
   by hostname of file server):
   10.0.2.15	clienthostname
   X.X.X.X	serverhostname

2. Edit the file "/etc/fstab" by adding the shared filesystem.
   Add this line at the end of the file: 
   serverhostname:/Path/To/Shared/Folder /Net nfs rw,net 0 0

3. Load the edited files using these commands from the command
   line:
   su
   niload hosts / < /etc/hosts
   niload fstab / < /etc/fstab

4. Reboot. The shared folder should be accessible from /Net
   directory. You can confirm that the operation was successful
   using this command:
   /usr/etc/showmount -e serverhostname


Howto: Open the above files using root privileges (NeXTstep 3.3):
   a  Open the /etc directory with this command in Terminal:
      "open /etc"
   b  Select the file to open and from Workspace select 
      Services > Open Sesame > Open As Root.
